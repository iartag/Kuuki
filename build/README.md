# Flashing Firmware on Windows

For Flashing the Firmware to your board using Windows, download the content of the folder [windows](./windows). Don't move the files in it to other locations. Execute the `flash-firmware.cmd`. A new cmd Window will be opened and you have to enter the Serial Port your board is connected through. A list of connected Devices is listed for you: 

![Specify COM Port](./windows/specify-com-port.png)

Then press Enter to start the flash process. This task takes one to three minutes. When the process was successful, the window closes itself automatically. 

![Flashing on Going](./windows/flashing-on-going.png)

Afterwards the board can be disconnected from the computer and the system is ready to use.
