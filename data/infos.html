			<h2 id="ranges">Ideal Ranges</h2>
			<div id="rangeValues">
				<div>
					<h3 id="temperature">Temperature</h3>
						<h4>19°C to 24°C</h4>
							<p>The infection rate of viruses is
							significantly reduced at room temperature (20°C)
							compared to colder temperatures (e.g. 4°C).
							Whereas, at warmer temperatures
							(30°C), transmission of influenza viruses is
							blocked or becomes highly inefficient. Maintaining
							temperature at the ideal level not only lessens the
							risk of virus transmission but also keeps you
							comfortable indoors.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div>
					<h3 id="co2">Carbon Dioxide</h3>
						<h4>Below 800ppm</h4>
							<p>Carbon Dioxide has long been used as an indicator
							of good indoor air quality primarily because of its
							association with ventilation. When carbon dioxide
							levels are high, it may indicate that your space is
							not well ventilated. The ideal level of CO2 is
							needed to reduce the risk of lung inflammation.</p>
							
							<p>Chronic inflammation caused by persistent high
							CO2 levels is not ideal for your health. Moreover,
							longer exposure to high CO2 can cause fatigue,
							headaches, and dizziness. It is also possible to
							develop hypercapnia acidosis, characterized by
							increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood.
							This suppresses immune function and can make
							one more susceptible to disease.</p> 
							
							<p>Some causes of carbon dioxide elevation indoors:
							improperly maintained combustion devices and
							poor ventilation.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div>
					<h3 id="humidity">Relative Humidity</h3>
						<h4>40% - 60%</h4>
							<p>In environments with lower than 40% Relative
							Humidity (RH), droplets from a cough or a sneeze
							lose their moisture quickly. This results in droplets
							becoming ‘dry aerosols’ and capable of staying in
							the air for longer periods. Viral particles remain
							infectious much longer below 40% and above
							80%.</p>
							
							<p>Virus particles are most inactive at 50% humidity,
							and retain their infectiousness the further from
							that median value, plateauing at 20% and 80%,
							respectively. Staying within 40% to 60% relative
							humidity is ideal from a comfort perspective but
							50% is the most ideal in terms of fast virus
							inactivation.</p>
							
							<p>Keeping the humidity at the ideal range not only
							helps you stay comfortable but also keeps you
							healthy. Low humidity (less than 30%) may
							promote dry nasal passage which makes people
							more susceptible to cold viruses while high
							humidity (more than 70%) may promote mold
							growth which can be harmful to people with
							weakened immune systems.</p>
